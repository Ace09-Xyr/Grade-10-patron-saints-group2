<span class="bold"> Peter Canasius </span> taught that, while there are many roads leading to Jesus Christ, for him the veneration of the Blessed Virgin Mary was the best. His sermons and letters document a clear preoccupation with Marian veneration. Under the heading "prayer" he explains the Hail Mary prayer as the basis for Catholic Marian piety. Less known are his Marian books, in which he published prayers and contemplative texts. To the Hail Mary he added the sentence, Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, which was not at that time commonly recited after the Angelic Salutation. Eleven years later it was included in the Catechism of the Council of Trent of 1566.

<br>
<br>

Theologically, Canisius defended Catholic Mariology in his 1577 book, De Maria Virgine Incomparabili et Dei Genitrice Sacrosancta Libri Quinque. The book was ordered by Pope Pius V to present a factual presentation of the Catholic Marian teachings in the Bible, the early Christians, the Church Fathers and contemporary theology. Canisius explains and documents Church teachings through the ages regarding the person and character of Mary, her virtues and youth. He traces historical documents about the perpetual virginity of Mary, and her freedom from sin. He explains the dogma of "Mother of God" with numerous quotations from the fathers after the Council of Ephesus. He shows that Church teaching has not changed. He answers the sola scriptura arguments of Protestants by analyzing the biblical basis for Mariology. Book five explains the Catholic view of the assumption as living faith for centuries, supported by most prominent Church writers.

<br>
<br>

From today's perspective, Canisius clearly erred in some of his sources, but, because of his factual analysis of original sources, it is considered as representing one of the best theological achievements in the 16th century.
